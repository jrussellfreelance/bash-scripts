## Bash Scripts
### 4/27/25: more updates are coming!

The lack of proper maintenance on these scripts is in large part due to being busy and only having time to archive new script ideas rather than actually write and test them.  Another reason is I've recently been focused on a selfhosted / low cost setup that gives the user control over their most sensitive data by being hosted locally and accessed remotely from a VPN.

The model I'm developing is intended to be easy to use and quick to set up on basically any reliably working hardware, like old desktops/laptops, rack servers, micro servers, $5 cloud server, and other easy options.  There should be an easy to follow guide that explains how to choose a hosting option, purchase a domain, and if desired, subscribe to dynDNS.  Then it should be clear how to choose and set up the apps that will bring you the most benefit for what you are wanting to do, like hosting a Plex media server, a DNS filtering service, a financial planning app, and so much more.  The data can easily be hosted locally and accessed remotely with a properly configured VPN, removing the need to use publicly accessible domains as much for intranet comms and internal ops.

These tools play a vital role in my workflow as I use them to deliver value and insight into my clients' problems, designing a solution so they can succeed.

I have a lot of scripts in the pipeline and will be overhauling this repo at that time.  Thanks for your patience!

My goal is to create a set of tools for streamlining and automating the overhead and costs when you are self-employed.

My desire is to demonstrate that contracting doesn't have to be painful or costly self-employed.have  with the right tools that aspiring consultants  and running with just a few basic, reliable tools.
